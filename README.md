Welcome to BlueCompiler! 
===================


This is a barebones compiler written with the project [IFC Allignment](https://www.cms.bgu.tum.de/de/forschung/projekte/31-forschung/projekte/411-ifcalignment) in mind.  The interpreter was written in C++ for the project but it has scope to be plugged in with an LLVM implementation (refer developer documentation for details). A complete list of supported tokens and the supported inbuilt functions are provided below. A example program is also included to showcase what this language can do.

Feel free to extend and modify the source code as you please but please remeber to provide references to this repo.
